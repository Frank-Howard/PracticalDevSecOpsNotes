# Errors with labs

I had a similar problem uploading results to DefectDojo in the VM modules. There was an error 500 message stating that there was an argument missing and therefore the upload had failed. This is an error discussed in the labs, however it isn't fixable. The real reason was because the production machine had not linked properly for whatever reason and therefore the solution proposed didn't fix the error. The DevSecOps staff just advised me to restart the lab if this happened because they were unable to find a solution
